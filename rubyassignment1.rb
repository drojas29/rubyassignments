#Create a function that takes a string and adds the phrase "Only in America!" to the end of it.
# I decided to write an each loop so that it prints both items in the array with the Only in America
# string =after it

america_things = ["Cronut", "Hot dog"]

america_things.each do |thing|
	puts "#{thing}s Only in America!"
end

# having trouble finding the max value of an array. I know you mentioned using the each loop is important here
#but not undertanding how to print only the max value

#max_value_array = [1,5,10,20]

#max_value_array.each do max { |a, b|  }

tech_companies = {search:["google", "yahoo"], music: ["best", "sucks"]}

# I know there's a way here to get the code to access the array in a way that it matches google with 
#best and yahoo with sucks. What I don't quite understand is how keys and values are different and how
#they play into the function here

#fizzbuzz

# This sounds like an if function where we print the number if not divisible by 3 or 5, print fizz if
#divisible by 3 and buzz if divisible by 5 while fizzbuzz if divisible by both numbers
